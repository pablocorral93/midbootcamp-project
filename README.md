## Project Description
I believe physical activity and balanced nutrition play a pivotal role in enhancing physical health, mental well-being, and overall quality of life.
My goal with this project is to bring awareness of how important these two factors are for our overall wellness.


## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to gather and analyze data that reflect people's perceptions of the importance of physical activity and nutrition on their overall wellness. The insights gained will help in understanding public opinion and potentially guide future health initiatives.

## Hypotheses
To test the importance of physical activity and balanced nutrition, I conducted a survey with a sample of 216 individuals. Each participant was asked to rate, on a scale of 1 to 5, how important they believe sports and nutrition are for their overall wellness.

## Key Hypotheses:
Physical Activity Hypothesis: Individuals who rate physical activity (sports) with a score of 3.5 or higher believe it is important for their overall wellness.
Nutrition Hypothesis: Individuals who rate balanced nutrition with a score of 3.5 or higher believe it is important for their overall wellness.
Data Collection
Sample Size: 216 individuals
Survey Questions: Participants were asked to rate the importance of sports and balanced nutrition on a scale of 1 to 5.
Rating Scale:
1: Not important
2: Slightly important
3: Moderately important
4: Very important
5: Extremely important

## Data Analysis
The data will be analyzed to determine the percentage of participants who consider physical activity and balanced nutrition as important for their overall wellness (a rating of 3.5 or higher).

## Conclusion
The results of this project will be used to understand the general perception of physical activity and nutrition in relation to wellness. The findings could serve as a foundation for further research and health awareness campaigns.
